# Screen light generator

A simple and BORING web page that generates a single color based on a text or a image, turning your screen into a light source (phone, tablet, or computer). 

It's especially useful as a fill light for taking photos, particularly for selfies and portraits!

Note: Since this is a browser-based application, the light brightness needs to be adjusted manually through your device's system settings.

Inspired by an iOS app: [小猫补光灯](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E5%B0%8F%E7%8C%AB%E8%A1%A5%E5%85%89%E7%81%AF/id6737742513) by @陈云飞
